## Instruction

This folder contains the candidate designs and the applications of our designs.

- `index.html`: The candidate animations for staged elaborate designs of the 8 aggregation operations.
- `apps.html`: The animation design of more complicate aggregation such as a box plot, a histogram, and a bootstrap process.

To run this, you need to launch a local webserver. For example:

```shell
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000 # for Python 2
$ python -m http.server 9000 # for Python 3
```

Then go to [http://localhost:9000/] to open the files.
