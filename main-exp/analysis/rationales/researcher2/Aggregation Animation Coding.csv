,Embellished Animation Unnecessary,count,static,baseline,elaborate,"For the first one, it was slow enough so I could see what was happening. I didn't think the fourth one was that good because it's not necessary to plot the points for each count and it confused me"
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,count,static,baseline,simple,The line and fancy transition for my 3rd and 4th pick were kind of confusing.
,Embellished Animation Unnecessary,count,static,baseline,simple,Transition the axes after transitioning the points. Having a reference line helps a lot.
,,iqr,static,baseline,simple,"While I liked the segmenting around the median, it didn't work in this situation"
,Animation Should Be Faster,max,static,baseline,simple,"Again, maximum is an easy and well known concept to present. The 1st one has the shortest animation time, cut to the chase."
,Embellished Animation Unnecessary,max,static,baseline,simple,"The first one is most simple, it is obvious that the everything that disappeared are values that are not the maximum. I liked the second one as well, but thought the transition was a little slow. I wasn't sure what the purpose of the lines were on the 3rd one, so I ranked it last."
,Embellished Animation Unnecessary,min,static,baseline,simple,"Same rationale as the maximum, minimum is an easy concept to present and doesn't need that much animation"
,Animation Should Be Faster,min,static,baseline,simple,"The ones with animations were too slow, it didn't seem like they were communicating anything"
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,stdev,static,baseline,simple,"All 4 were about as hard, but having the transitions easing in made it slightly better."
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,sum,static,baseline,simple,"None of them showed me the sum in a followable way, I just had to trust they were correct"
,,count,static,simple,baseline,The animation of the graphs in 1st place was nice
,Animation Unnecessary,max,static,simple,baseline,I felt that no animation was necessary to show that the topmost element is the maximum of each set.
,Animation Should Be Faster,max,static,simple,baseline,"It is very obvious with the first one that it is the maximum, 2nd one animation was too slow"
,Animation Unnecessary,max,static,simple,baseline,it's better to show maximum by only deleting other lower dots
,Animation Unnecessary,max,static,simple,baseline,Max is easy to understand. Animation are just a waste of time. I could possibly see the animation I ranked 2 (the one where a bar appears) being useful if there's a cluster of similar data points at the top.
,Animation Should Be Faster,max,static,simple,baseline,Simplicity is best for max and i felt that the second too were too slow and took too long
,Embellished Animation Unnecessary,max,static,simple,baseline,"While the one ranked first didn't have anything fancy, looking for max should be simple and this does that"
,Embellished Animation Unnecessary,min,static,simple,baseline,it's better to show minimum by deleting any other upper dots
,,min,static,simple,baseline,Same ranking as the one before for the same reasons
,Animation Unnecessary,min,static,simple,baseline,"See answer for max. Animations are less helpful for obvious cases, but a line could be useful if the data clusters at min."
,Animation Unnecessary,min,static,simple,baseline,"Similar to my answer for maximum, I felt that no animation was necessary. That being said, the line-drawing animation felt easier to see than the fade-out."
,Animation Should Be Faster,min,static,simple,baseline,The second too are too slow and take too long for a minimum
,,stdev,static,simple,elaborate,The 1st place graph is much more clear than the other ones
,Embellished Animation Unnecessary,avg,simple,baseline,elaborate,Displaying the average before the transition helps with finding the value but the extra animation in the last transition just makes the animation too cluttered.
,,avg,simple,baseline,elaborate,I felt that the animation that draws a line and collapses them was the easies to understand.
,,avg,simple,baseline,elaborate,"i like that it shows the average first, helps distinguish it from being a median"
,,avg,simple,baseline,elaborate,I liked following the dots to see where they were going with the line indication
,,avg,simple,baseline,elaborate,I liked how the line for my first choice made it clear how it was the average.
,,avg,simple,baseline,elaborate,"I liked that the top ranked one showed the eventual destination of the points, although the 2nd ranked one was also effective. The 3rd ranked one was unnecessarily complicated, and the 4th one  was too abrupt."
,,avg,simple,baseline,elaborate,Seeing the values move made it easier to tell exactly where they were going
,"Couldn't Follow Complex Animations, Extra Complexity Unnecessary",iqr,simple,baseline,elaborate,"1st is simple, like in the median example. 2nd is also simple because often interquartile will line up exactly on a point. 3rd is very fancy looking and again very distracting, although explains the algorithm you might consider pretty well. 4th option is a jump cut and disorienting."
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,iqr,simple,baseline,elaborate,"Assigning four colors to each quartile is extremely helpful, however, the last transition is a bit too fast to understand what is going on"
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,iqr,simple,baseline,elaborate,"I like how the 1st graph utilizes hue to showcase the various quartiles and how they make up the resulting box plot. The 3rd graph again suffers from too many transitions that speed up too quickly at the end, which cause me to replay the animation again to understand the changes. The 4th animation needed to be replayed multiple times, as the change is immediate and does not show me how the data relates to the resulting box plot."
,,iqr,simple,baseline,elaborate,"In the third animation which I ranked #1, it was helpful to see which points marked the edges of the quartile"
,,iqr,simple,baseline,elaborate,The same reason as the previous question. It just came more intuitive to me.
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,iqr,simple,baseline,elaborate,"The top option got the idea across the clearest and at the right speed. This time, the faster, more complicated viz on the right was overly complicated and I picked the fading one before it. The abrupt transition got last place."
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,median,simple,baseline,elaborate,"At first, I did not like the animation I chose 1st, because I did not understand what the animation is trying to show me. Now, I understand the color coding shows you which data points are above the median and which are below, which helps me understand how the median relates to the data points. While I found the use of hue helpful, I still preferred the 2nd graph to the 3rd because I am not a fan of the step transition, especially because it speeds up towards the end, leaving me to replay the animation to understand how the data was transformed. The 4th graph suffers from the same problem of me having to replay the animation multiple times to understand how the median was calculated."
,,median,simple,baseline,elaborate,i like that it shows the two sides before fading it out. helps show its a median
,,median,simple,baseline,elaborate,I liked how my first choice had the green and orange representing the two halves around the median.
,,median,simple,baseline,elaborate,Showing the split of values greater/lesser than the median really drives the point home.
,Embellished Animation Unnecessary,median,simple,baseline,elaborate,The coloring and animation on the rightmost one is too much but the third one is enough and is easier to understand that it is the median.
,,median,simple,baseline,elaborate,The separation of points to show how many were on each side of the chosen dots made it clear that this was a median operation
,,median,simple,baseline,elaborate,Transition should show correctly how we count from both sides to get the median.
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,median,simple,baseline,elaborate,"What was the least distracting and what made the most sense. It didn't make sense for the median to just appear between them, but the animations of the right-most one were very distracting."
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,stdev,simple,baseline,elaborate,"1st because attention is drawn to the average before dots disappear and the standard deviation appears. 2nd because you can see the data and the standard deviation at the same time during the fade. 3rd because showing the difference from the average is confusing when only the differences to the average are transformed into only the higher standard deviation and not both. 4th because it is just a hard transition so we aren't aware that there is any mathematics with the data, it might just be a different graph entirely."
,,stdev,simple,baseline,elaborate,"1st one shows exactly how we get the data value, the middle slice represents the average. 3rd one the transition is too fancy and distracting."
,,stdev,simple,baseline,elaborate,"i like that it shows the first half first, then the next half"
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,sum,simple,baseline,elaborate,"4th is because the jump from value to sum is abrupt and doesn't have any clues about the value is jumping to. 3rd is because it feels like there is too much going on. I don't have much of a preference of 1st over 2nd, but even though the motions are similar 1st makes it seem like all the points are being scooped into a new value which makes it seem like it's adding all those values together."
,Embellished Animation Unnecessary,sum,simple,baseline,elaborate,"(1st) I like how summing animation and zoom out on axis was staggered, making it easier to see. 
(2nd) It is kind of hard to see, but points converging and axis moving sententiously gives us a sense that they are being added up.
(3rd) I really dont see they it is necessary to draw lines down to x axis."
,Embellished Animation Unnecessary,sum,simple,baseline,elaborate,adding an auxiliary line is a nice feature to have. but I think the 3rd is a little bit too much for my taste.
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,sum,simple,baseline,elaborate,How easy it was to follow what was going on.  The one I ranked third was cool but kinda confusing
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,sum,simple,baseline,elaborate,"I like how the graph I picked as first shows the relationship of the data points with the sum. The 2nd graph also does this, but to a lesser degree. The additional transitions in the 3rd graph were jarring, but still got the point across. The 4th graph was too much of a leap and took longer to adjust to the changes."
,,sum,simple,baseline,elaborate,"I like the lines in the 1st one, helped me follow along and see what data the point corresponded to. The animation also helped me understand we were adding things together."
,,sum,simple,baseline,elaborate,Knowing that the numbers were aggregated together when finding the two final points.
,,sum,simple,baseline,elaborate,Showing the relative position to the bottom axis and then adding all of them together
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,sum,simple,baseline,elaborate,"The gathering of dots was helpful.  The one where they went diagonal was confusing, but still better than the static one"
,,sum,simple,baseline,elaborate,there isn't too much information (last one has too many lines that threw me off)
,,avg,simple,baseline,static,I really liked the showing the average and then how the points converge to that
,,avg,simple,baseline,static,"Showing the dots slide into the average is helpful, you can see the average before the transition is over"
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,count,simple,baseline,static,How easy it was to follow what was going on
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,max,simple,baseline,static,1st is best since it tells the user to focus on the max before the other data points fade. 2nd is the same as 1st without the focus. 3rd is simply too abrupt to track on first try.
,,max,simple,baseline,static,"1st: best as it fades out unnecessary points, with a tick mark to show significance/importance of that particular point.
2nd: fading out points
3rd: no animation, hard to figure out what happened"
,Animation Should Be Slower,max,simple,baseline,static,"3rd is still abrupt and while it's easy tell the maxes of these two sets, if the points were more clumped together it might be difficult to see immediately that they are the maxes. 2nd is better because the other points fade out, giving the audience time to determine that those two points are the largest in their respective sets. 1st is the best because it clearly marks the max before the other points fade."
,,max,simple,baseline,static,"A transition is helpful to know nothing is just randomly being taken out, and the line specifies its a value to pay attention to, not just the last point."
Clear Metaphor,,max,simple,baseline,static,"All pretty clear, but having the line through emphasizes it better"
Clear Metaphor,,max,simple,baseline,static,Clear selection of top value by using a thick line while all points were visible
Clear Metaphor,,max,simple,baseline,static,extra lines can really help me with understanding things like this
Clear Metaphor,,max,simple,baseline,static,Having the lines go through the dots first made it quicker for me to realize what was going to be highlighted.
Clear Metaphor,,max,simple,baseline,static,I chose #1 because the line through the top points made me think those points were significant and demonstrated that every other point was below those with the lines. I did not think #2 and #3 were that different in terms of communicating maximum but I liked the animation on #2 more.
Clear Metaphor,,max,simple,baseline,static,I chose the 1st because it has a line that underlines the maximum and convey to audience that we are looking at the maximum value. 2nd one is similar but did not have the line. 3rd one did not have any transitio.
Clear Metaphor,,max,simple,baseline,static,"I chose the third transition as first as it showcased a line through the maximum points before erasing that line and all lower points from the set, describing what the maximum is the best. The  second transition is only second because it does not add in that information, but it does erase lower points in the set. The first transition is static, so no animations are shown and it describes the maximum the least."
,,max,simple,baseline,static,"I don't really know but feels like it okay, I believe."
,Animation Should Be Slower,max,simple,baseline,static,I just didn't like how abrupt my 3rd choice was.
,,max,simple,baseline,static,"I like that the one I ranked as 1st brings attention to the top value before fading out the lower ones. The one ranked 2nd still faded them out, which I thought looked nicer than just removing the lower points."
,,max,simple,baseline,static,I like the first 1 the most is that it marked the maximum before other data points disappear. For 2nd and 3rd I simply think has transition is better than not having one.
,,max,simple,baseline,static,I liked how 1st brought your attention to what was the max then showed getting rid of the remaining.
Clear Metaphor,,max,simple,baseline,static,"It clearly selects the maximums, so it is easy to visualize"
,,max,simple,baseline,static,Line is a nice gridmark. Lack of animation is tough
,,max,simple,baseline,static,Marking the max as in 1 helps to notice the dots as relative to the other dots before the other dots disappear. The 2nd is better at maintaining the non max dots a little longer for comparison than 1.
,,max,simple,baseline,static,marks the points so easier to see it's choosing the top values before fading
Understandable,,max,simple,baseline,static,More visual aid in the 1st visualization made it more easy to understand
,,max,simple,baseline,static,The animation draws attention to the points of interest before fading out the others.
,,max,simple,baseline,static,The emphasis on the highest data point with a short line.
,,max,simple,baseline,static,"The first two are either two slow or doesn't show enough, the last one has a good feel to it"
,,max,simple,baseline,static,The line displayed made me pay attention to the points. You could clearly tell the points were data points already in the set.
,,max,simple,baseline,static,the line draws attention to the max so its easier to see
,,max,simple,baseline,static,The line rather than just the transition made the focus on the top element more obvious
Clear Metaphor,,max,simple,baseline,static,"The lines on the transition marked as first give the sense that the line is the maximum of the set,  a sense neither of the other transitions convey well."
,,max,simple,baseline,static,The marking lines on the max values was clear. The fading away of the other values was also nice.
,,max,simple,baseline,static,"The same reason, I love the smooth transition which makes data more easier to visualize"
,,max,simple,baseline,static,The third graphic is slightly more emphatic about choosing the highest value than the second is.
,,max,simple,baseline,static,"They're all about the same, coherence-wise. I just liked the smooth animation in the first place one better than the second, and the second better than no animation at all."
,,max,simple,baseline,static,Using the marker helps draw the eye to the max in the original graph.
,,max,simple,baseline,static,"Your eye is drawn to the top values, and then the other values fade out, to show that they do not matter for this calculation"
,Annoying,median,simple,baseline,static,"I liked how it showed removing from the top and bottom, but doing it one by one was kind of annoying to watch and distracting"
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"Again, seeing the line while we could see all the points was helpful for reference."
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"As with the maximum ranking, the line on the transition marked first gives the sense that the data goes no lower than the line, and neither of the other transitions convey this sense well."
Clear Metaphor,,min,simple,baseline,static,"For the same reasons as maximum, the line showing up in the ""First"" animation is nice to be clear about what data point we're talking about, the animation on the 1st and second place ones are nice, and the lack of animation on the third one still works but is less pretty."
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"Highlighting the minimum before the animation helps us know to focus on that before the other points disappear
"
,,min,simple,baseline,static,I like 1st one the most because it marked minimum before other data points disappears. For 2nd and 3rd I simply think have animation is better than not having one.
,,min,simple,baseline,static,I liked 1st because it drew your attention to the minimum then removed the remaining ones
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"I liked the line for my first choice, made it clear what I should look at."
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"I ranked these the same way as maximum, and for the same reasons. The fading is less abrupt, and the top ranked one brings attention to the minimum before removing the other values."
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"It's hard to see what to pay attention to when it's near the bottom, so the lines were helpful."
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"Like for max, transition needed to show points removed for reason, line emphasizes the value."
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"Line is a nice gridmark. Animation is nice, but too slow is weird"
,,min,simple,baseline,static,marks the bottom points so easier to tell what stays before fading
Clear Metaphor,,min,simple,baseline,static,My choices for this were pretty much for the same reasons as with maximum. I like the line because it highlights the specific points and shows that every other point is above the one with the line. I like the animation on #2 more than #3 but I don't think one is significantly more communicative than the other.
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"Now I see why adding a line to demarcate the point may be important, since there is some clustering happening at the bottom."
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"Same as before, how appealing and how it shows the work done."
,,min,simple,baseline,static,Same as maximum -- the line going through the bottom made it quicker to decipher what was going on.
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"Same as maximum, your eye is drawn to the bottommost points before the others fade out"
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"same as previous: 
fading points out helps, as well as extra tick mark."
,,min,simple,baseline,static,same as the last one that i wrote the answer for
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"Same reason as maximum but the fade is definitely way better than the immediate transition. As a user, I would like to make sure that the points were in the data set and the transition was just a filter."
,,min,simple,baseline,static,Same reasons as given in the explanations for ranking maximum.
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"Same thing as maximum, line through it highlights minimum bette"
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"same with  max, i like extra lines when it comes to max and min"
,,min,simple,baseline,static,Showing the min of the original graph helps draw the eye to the min.
,,min,simple,baseline,static,Similar to max. It's nice to be able to compare the min dots to the non min dots before the other dots disappear. The 1st one does this better than the 2nd one by marking it explicitly.
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"Similar to the maximum transitions, I chose the ranking in this order because of the same reasons. I like the line underlining the minimum because it shows clearly that we are looking at the minimum"
,,min,simple,baseline,static,The emphasis on the lowest data point with a short line.
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"The horizontal, marking lines draws your attention to which values will stay around."
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"the line draws attention to the min, so its easier to see. also faster fade"
,,min,simple,baseline,static,The reasoning is the same as for the previous graphs for maximum.
,,min,simple,baseline,static,The same reason as the previous one for the same visual aid
Clear Metaphor,,min,simple,baseline,static,The same reason as the previous question. It just came more intuitive to me.
,,min,simple,baseline,static,"The same reason, the last one gives more smooth transition and animation compared to the first two."
Clear Metaphor,,min,simple,baseline,static,The third graphic is the most emphatic about selecting the minimum.
Clear Metaphor,,min,simple,baseline,static,"The third transition is the best because it showed a line through the minimum of the sets before deleting all higher points and the line, thus showcasing the best which element is the minimum and why. The second transition does not use the line at all and only eliminates higher elements than the minimum in the animation, which is why it is only second. The first transition is last due to no animations being used, therefore it does not do anything into aiding why what is shown is the minimum."
,Animation Should Be Slower,min,simple,baseline,static,"The transitions can be too fast, the one that selects it catches your eye."
,,min,simple,baseline,static,Whether it clearly marks the remaining element is the smallest within each set
,,stdev,simple,baseline,static,"I like this one the most, but didn't really like that the upper and lower sd were shown separately"
,,stdev,simple,baseline,static,I liked a slow transition for this one because theres a lot that goes into it and being able to keep track of what the line represented in addition to the standard deviation was helpful
,Animation Should Be Slower,avg,simple,elaborate,baseline,"1st is my favorite as the middle line shows the average before merging the data points. 2nd is actually a bit confusing in my opinion, though I still understand what it's trying to convey. 3rd seems a bit like a sum operation instead. 4th is simply too abrupt to catch."
,,avg,simple,elaborate,baseline,"I like the simplicity of the one I ranked first, while it is clear that the average might not land on a direct point"
,,avg,simple,elaborate,baseline,"I liked identifying what the average was then the collapse, the 2nd one and 1st were pretty tied, 2nd just didn't seem to add much for me with the extra animation."
,Metaphor Unclear,avg,simple,elaborate,baseline,"I see what you were going for with the bars, but it's not very explicit. Maybe if the bars flipped over the center divider and canceled each other out."
,Embellished Animation unnecessary,avg,simple,elaborate,baseline,I think the lines on the 2nd place one make it too busy for this one. For the first one it's helpful to see the line appear before to know that it's average and not median since it isn't going through a dot or exactly between two dots
,,avg,simple,elaborate,baseline,"In this case I did like the horizontal lines at the mean, as it isn't necessarily an existing point. The version showing deviation from the mean was nice as well."
,,avg,simple,elaborate,baseline,It’s nice to see where the average will be before dots start moving
,,avg,simple,elaborate,baseline,The 1st and 2nd ranked charts give a clear frame of reference for the average and how the points contribute to it. The bars beneath the dots in the 2nd ranked chart seem like a bit too much information though. Both the 3rd and 4th ranked charts don't give a clear indication that the resulting points are actually the location of the average.
Clear Metaphor,,avg,simple,elaborate,baseline,the animation of the 3rd and 4th chart makes the transition of average much clearer.
,,avg,simple,elaborate,baseline,"The horizontal lines that were drawn show that it is average for me, since they dont align with a dot it seems more like an average"
,Animation Should Be Slower,avg,simple,elaborate,baseline,The line for the one I ranked first was straightforward. The one ranked 3rd took a bit too long and the one I ranked second had the line but the bar graph was a bit distracting
Clear Metaphor,Animation Should Be Faster,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"1st and 2nd could be interchangeable since I don't prefer one over the other. 4th is because the jump from values to counts is abrupt and also unclear. 3rd is because is it also somewhat unclear - without the numbers on the side, it could easily have been average or median. 1st and 2nd lay out all the dots in a line so it's more clear that it's the count."
Clear Metaphor,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,1st and 2nd were higher than 3rd and 4th because we can see the number of dots lined up nicely making it obvious there was a count. I liked 1st more than 2nd because of the smoother transition. 3rd was higher than 4th because there seems some correlation between first and second graph while in the 4th I wouldn't be able to tell the two charts related if I didn't know they were related already
Clear Metaphor,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"1st and second were close, they both described it in an intuitive manner, i just preferred the one i labeled 1st's transition for aesthetic purposes. 3rd is somewhat vague when they combined, but the value that they transition to lends itself to being a count if you had an idea of how many elements there were to begin with. The 4th simply showed no correlation between previous elements and the numbers that it ends up with, so you would have to have an idea of what you were looking for or the counts beforehand to know what you're looking at."
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"1st one shows that they are uniformly counted. However, 3rd and 4th did not have a clear transition which could be confusing."
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"#1 ranked chart showed the transition from individual data points to count in a quick and smooth animation. Each of the other charts were worse due to either jittery transitions, slow transitions, or no apparent animation (ranked in that order from 2nd to 4th)."
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"Animation is important feature. 1st and 2nd both animate the data points two be having the same value so that it's easier to count them. 1st has smoother animation so I like it the best. 3rd it's harder to tell since data points collapse, and 4th has no animation so I don't like it."
Clear Metaphor,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"Chose the #1 and #2 because they were clearly showing the number of points spaced evenly (because they all count as one value). I chose #1 over #2 because I liked the smoothness of the transition better. I thought #3 had nice animation but it didn't show each point evenly spaced before grouping them into one point, which is what made #1 and #2 clearly a count. #4 did not have any animation so I just had to guess what it was showing."
Clear Metaphor,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"Easy to see how each point contributes to the corresponding y axis value, and see they all count for 1 (their own count)."
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,elucidating how the same features of one graph turn into another (smoother transitions are better)
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,For the transitions I ranked 1 and 2 it was much easier to follow the dots to see that count was being calculated
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,How well I could see that all the points were accounted for. The static one was too fast.
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,how well the change vertical scale corresponded to where the points on the chart were.
Clear Metaphor,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"i like how points were moved to be stacked at equal distance before final point for count was selected, as it gives us visual sense of count, regardless of their actual values"
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"I like the smoothness of #1 and #2. #1 is slightly better because it's more fluid and I can keep track of it easier.
I don't like #4- the instant movement is too hard to keep track of.
#3 makes me thing of a sum rather than count"
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"I liked how the count divided them into even stacking, which helped imply counting, then the reveal showed a nice change for the axis"
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,I liked how the line up of data points emphasized the count.
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,I liked that you could clearly count the number of dots from the animation
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"I liked when it lined up all the dots, and my first choice was smoother"
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,Leftmost transition was too abrupt. Second from left was smooth but difficult to understand what was going on when dots collapsed at once. Third from left was less staggered than rightmost which had a bit too many transitions that felt distracting
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,Seeing the dots lined up evenly spaced shows how many there are
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"smooth animation that doesn't make me question what is happening at first. (first one theres no animation, second looks like points combine)"
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,Smooth transition evokes bar charts and an actual counting of the dots. Staged animation is confusing when all the dots look the same and move along the same line.
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,The animation felt smoother and was slow enough that i could track it with my eyes
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"The dots simply rearranged without overlapping each other, and simply numbered each one."
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"The effectiveness of the animations or lack of one. For e.g., in the third and fourth one, the equal spacing between the data points really helped."
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,The fact that it showed them stacked up uniformly in a smooth transition
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"The feature that led me to this order was first the animation displaying the change, and then the animation to first showcase each individual point in the graph before collapsing them in a smooth transition. The third transition had all of this, so it came in first. The last transition came in second because it displayed the points, but moved them in a jarring way that wasn't pleasant to see. The second transition had animations, but didn't make it clear how many points there were, it just collapsed them. The first transition was just a static change, which didn't describe the count nearly as well as the others, which is why it is last."
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,"The most obvious feature was the laying out of the values along the axis, followed by selecting the highest value.  The third transition did this most smoothly, followed by the fourth and then the second.  The first did not at all."
,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,The ones with smoothness and continuity made it easier to track the dots

,Animation Should Be Faster,iqr,simple,elaborate,baseline,"I liked the splitting by colors and having a longer pause to process what was happening compared to 2nd, it just was constant movement and made the transition a little more confusing."
Understandable,Measure Was Too Confusing,iqr,simple,elaborate,baseline,"I prefer the first because as someone who doesn't exactly know what an ""interquartile range"" was, I got to see the animation of how it's calculated.

The one I ranked second is too busy (not sure why all the dots needed to pop out...) .

,,iqr,simple,elaborate,baseline,It is really helpful for them to split vertically so I can see that this is centered on the median
,,iqr,simple,elaborate,baseline,It is very important to show the different quartiles on the points as different colors.  I don't feel counting out each point in the quartiles adds anything to the visualization except add unnecessary motion to distract the viewer from the data.
,Measure Was Too Confusing,iqr,simple,elaborate,baseline,"No animation is bad
1st and second are prettier, but I don't really understand the concept of interquartile range, so they all don't make much of a difference to me. The colors in 1st and second help me slightly understand the concept."
,,iqr,simple,elaborate,baseline,"once again, animation on 2nd rank plot is little too extra. 1st ranked animation is simply enough to show that there are equal number of points in all 4 segments"

,,iqr,simple,elaborate,baseline,Seeing precisely which points fit into which quartile was great. Seeing them classified simultaneously was better than two at a time.
,,iqr,simple,elaborate,baseline,"Seeing the dots split up into their quartiles before marking the average and interquartiles is helpful.

Clear metaphor,,iqr,simple,elaborate,baseline,The colors make it clear that we are splitting the data into four parts. The simpler animations still are helpful over more complicated ones.
,,iqr,simple,elaborate,baseline,The colors were very helpful in seeing why the bars line up with certain data points.

The second transition just had the plot show up again with no real prompt or information given unlike the third and last transitions, so it is third place. The first transition had no animation to aid with describing Interquartile Range with Median, so it comes in last."
,,iqr,simple,elaborate,baseline,"The top one left the points in place long enough to see how they were grouped. The 2nd ranked one did the same thing in a more complicated way. The 3rd one didn't group the points by color, which made it a little less clear, and the 4th one was too abrupt."

,,median,simple,elaborate,baseline,"How well the separation between the dots on either side of the median is shown.

,Animation Should Be Faster,median,simple,elaborate,baseline,"I thought the second and first ranked transitions were both good, but the second ranked was a little fast/ had too much going on.

,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,median,simple,elaborate,baseline,"The 3rd one was slightly hard to follow. The 1st one was nice because we slit the data set and it's colored so we know which data belongs to which point. This time, the line was nicer because it's emphasized that this point is the mid point."
,Animation Should Be Slower,median,simple,elaborate,baseline,The colors and dividing bar make it clear what is happening (that half the values are on each side). The difference between 1st and 2nd is that 2nd is too long.

,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,median,simple,elaborate,baseline,"The first one, you could see the different colors split between the first half and the second half, which I thought was really cool and easy to distinguish. The second one was kind of similar but it was little overwhelming with all the transitions, but again, the colors helped. The third one, I wasn't quite sure what was being distilled down into if I didn't know that it was describing median, and the fourth one was just too fast."
,Embellished animation unnecessary,median,simple,elaborate,baseline,"The third transition is the best for me because it showcased what the median is, highlighted which elements were higher and lower than that median, than erased all other elements. The last transition did all of these things, but also added a step animation, which I thought was excessive for explaining what the median was, so it is second. The second transition never showed what the median is, it just merged the points to that median, so it is third. The fourth transition was only a static transition with no animations, which did not aid in describing what the median was, so it is last."
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,median,simple,elaborate,baseline,"While the 1st and 2nd ranked were both easy-to-read transitions, the 1st ranked was less distracting"

,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,stdev,simple,elaborate,baseline,"1st: simple animation with some eyecandy. Better than 2nd because the 2nd is quite distracting - however, it explains the idea of standard deviation moderately well though. 3d is better than 4th because it allows some comparison between data points and the stdev while it's crossfading."
,Measure Was Too Confusing,stdev,simple,elaborate,baseline,"I don't really know what standard deviation is, but I think that the animations that show average first and some computation for the deviation next show that the are separate stats and show how they are computed more easily."

,,stdev,simple,elaborate,baseline,I like 1st one better because it's simpler and better shows that standard deviation is a positive number and symmetric on both side.
,,stdev,simple,elaborate,baseline,"I like that you see each part, but I like the simplicity of the one I ranked first"

,Embellished animation unnecessary,stdev,simple,elaborate,baseline,I think the 1st one's animation allowed me to see how the standard deviation was determined and what the average was 2nd one got a little messy with the barred animation

,,count,simple,elaborate,static,"My 3rd/4th choices use transitions that would make the user incorrectly associate what count is supposed to mean. Of the 1st/2nd, I preferred the smoother transition because the jerky motion could imply things that aren't part of the data."
,,count,simple,elaborate,static,Same  distance is a good visual cue for knowing it is being counted
Clear metaphor,,count,simple,elaborate,static,Seeing the dots stack up makes the most sense with counting the number of data points. The transition to the single dot is the least effective since it seems like we are using the data point's values to calculate the count.
,,count,simple,elaborate,static,"Smooth transitions help a lot, but removing the axis entirely and putting it back in is confusing"
Clear metaphor,,count,simple,elaborate,static,the first and second make it way more obvious what is going on by actually doing the count

,,count,simple,elaborate,static,"The smoothness of the transition to see the points not combined due to their value, but equally spread out to see the number of points."
,,count,simple,elaborate,static,The smoothness of the transition was the difference between the first one and second. How the data points remained on the screen made it easy to understand that it was doing a count.

,,stdev,baseline,elaborate,simple,1st is actually my favorite since it shows both sides of s.d. at once and I think the fade is sufficient to show transition. 2nd is good although I think it would be better to display both sides of s.d. at once. 3rd is confusing when the data points merge into one. 4th is simply too abrupt to catch.
,,stdev,baseline,elaborate,simple,Being able to see the data and the bar helps
,Metaphor Unclear,stdev,baseline,elaborate,simple,"I like how the 1st animation shows me both sides of the deviation in a single transition. The 2nd and 3rd transitions make me feel as though the data only affects one side of the deviation, which I know is not true. I chose the 2nd over the 3rd because I felt the step transition made me feel this was less true and that data did contribute to the second half of the deviation. I needed to replay the 4th graph multiple times to understand how it related to the data, which I do not think is very helpful."
,,stdev,baseline,elaborate,simple,It is easier to believe it is one standard deviation from the second graph
,,sum,baseline,elaborate,simple,"1st is actually my favorite because merging data points imply to me as a sum operation. 2nd is good as well, since it shows all the data points individually before merging - but what if there are too many data points to list each individually? 3rd's animation doesn't really convey any meaning, in my opinion, rather than serving as a transition for the change of scale for the y-axis. 4th is simply a switch of charts."
Clear metaphor,,sum,baseline,elaborate,simple,I like the 1st one because it seems to be merging the values which is how I usually visualize the summation. The second one is easy to understand but why it splits into the different sections is a little bit confusing. Having a bad merging animation in 3 is better than no animation in 4.
,,sum,baseline,elaborate,simple,The diagonal in the fourth transition added an extra confusing element. The second one was elegant

,,max,baseline,simple,static,1st one had simple animation that allowed me to see right away the max of a data set.
,,max,baseline,simple,static,"1st rank: simple ideas always good. 2nd rank: animation is better than none especially when maximum seems easy to distinguish already. evokes the idea of a ""cap"" to the data."
,Animation Should Be Slower,max,baseline,simple,static,Highlighting the top dots without adding unnecessary transition to wait
,Embellished Animation unnecessary,max,baseline,simple,static,How clear that the maximum was being shown. The right one was sort of distracting with the lines coming out.
,,max,baseline,simple,static,I like how it faded to get the maximum because I can tell how they got it
,,max,baseline,simple,static,I liked how the dots faded away so that you can see how the point left behind relates to the rest of the data
,Metaphor Unclear,max,baseline,simple,static,I think the bar on the 2nd is not so intuitive since all the audience know there are only 2 dots left. The 1st is good with the transitions since the audience could understand that why the other dots just disappeared.
,Embellished Animation unnecessary,max,baseline,simple,static,I thought the lines were unnecessary but I liked the fading dots
,Embellished Animation unnecessary,max,baseline,simple,static,"It was clear which point was the maximum, and focus was drawn well. I didn't think the line was necessary."
,,max,baseline,simple,static,More deliberate ways to show that we were only looking a one element in a set rather than some aggregation.
Clear Metaphor,,max,baseline,simple,static,"The 1st clearly shows that you only care about the largest element. The 2nd is similar, but I didn't understand the purpose of the line that appears through the max element. The 3rd is fine, but the sudden change might be harder to follow."
Clear Metaphor,,max,baseline,simple,static,The 1st rank just fades away the other points making it clear that we only care about the final displayed point.
,Metaphor Unclear,max,baseline,simple,static,The animation in 2nd and third provide me with an interpretation interval. I just don't see the point of having a line across the max point in the 3rd one.
,Embellished Animation unnecessary,max,baseline,simple,static,The extra line isn’t helpful in the third transition. The second is elegant
Clear metaphor,,max,baseline,simple,static,the middle graph gradually whites out the other data points which intuitively agrees with how my brain functions to pick the max.
,Embellished Animation unnecessary,max,baseline,simple,static,"The second chart is the best since the points irrelevant to the maximum gradually fades and disappears. The third chart's has some additional useless transition, which is somewhat better than the first one."
,Embellished Animation unnecessary,max,baseline,simple,static,The smooth ones were better.  The one with the lines sticking out seemed unnecessary
,,max,baseline,simple,static,The transitions. The smoother the easier to see. I felt like the middle one is cleaner. That's why I ranked it NO_1
,,max,baseline,simple,static,There are no motions of the dots but the dots themselves show things clearly
,,min,baseline,simple,static,1st and 2nd were practically equivalent and both demonstrated selecting the max by phasing out the others. 3rd was visually uninspiring.
,Embellished Animation unnecessary,min,baseline,simple,static,"Again, I thought the lines were unnecessary but I liked the fading"
,Metaphor Unclear,min,baseline,simple,static,"Exact same rationale as the max one (3rd is jerky, 2nd has an (unneeded?) line, 1st clearly shows the operation)."
,,min,baseline,simple,static,focusing on the bottom most dot but with some small transitions
,,min,baseline,simple,static,"For the same reason as the maximum transitions, the second is best"
,Embellished Animation unnecessary,min,baseline,simple,static,I don't prefer the lines in 2nd choice because it seems a little messy. The 1st one is a nice smooth transition.
Clear metaphor,,min,baseline,simple,static,I like how it faded to get the minimum because I can tell if it is right
,,min,baseline,simple,static,I liked being able to see the dots fade away so that you could tell how the remaining dot corresponded to all of the data.
,,min,baseline,simple,static,I would use the same argument as the max. The smoother the transition the better.
,,min,baseline,simple,static,More deliberate ways to show that we are looking at a single element in a set.
,,min,baseline,simple,static,"Same as maximum, the fade away of non minimum points highlighted the min."
,,min,baseline,simple,static,"Same as with maximum. Simple animation > any clear and concise animation > no animation, but all are pretty good for minimum because it's a simple idea."
,,min,baseline,simple,static,"Similar to the max graph comparison. In this case, it's very easy to get the minimum but it's just a matter if the transition looks comfortable visually."
,,min,baseline,simple,static,The 1st ranked transition fades away the non-min elements which helps pinpoint which ones we care about.
,Embellished Animation unnecessary,min,baseline,simple,static,"The same as the previous one. The second chart's transition fades out irrelevant information, the third chart has meaningless transition, but still better than the first one."
,Embellished Animation unnecessary,min,baseline,simple,static,The smooth ones were better than the abrupt one but the lines sticking out of one of them seemed unnecessary
,Animation Should Be Slower,min,baseline,simple,static,This has the same reason as the last question with max. I think 1st should have a faster transition. 3rd is not so intuitive since we don't know why the other points were gone. There should be a visual experience when the dots are leaving.
,Embellished Animation unnecessary,stdev,baseline,simple,static,Movement doesn't really seem necessary for this one -- just makes it harder to follow
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,sum,baseline,simple,static,"I liked 1 because you could see all the data points coming together (being summed) into one, which was self-explanatory. I didn't like 4 because there was too much graphics/info coming"
,Embellished Animation unnecessary,count,baseline,static,elaborate,"I think count is a very simple mathematical concept that most people are aware of, simple transition like the 1st one I pick is enough to show, too much animation is kind of redundant."
,,sum,baseline,static,elaborate,There is a change in the axis involved so the transition does not really help with the sum
,Animation Should Be Slower,avg,baseline,static,simple,The first one is not enough animation and the last two take too long
,,count,baseline,static,simple,everything looks good actually. I especially like the second one bcause of the motion of the dots.
,"Animation Should Be Faster, Metaphor Unclear",count,baseline,static,simple,"I like the smooth transition from the data in the graph I ranked 1st. The graph I ranked 2nd was not as easily to follow due to the abrupt change. The 3rd and 4th graph seemed misleading to me, as it seems like all the data points from the original graph (before the transition) somehow had to do something with the count, which is simply an aggregation. I picked the 3rd over the 4th because I think the 4th had too many unnecessary step transitions."
,Embellished Animation unnecessary,count,baseline,static,simple,The ones I ranked 3rd and 4th seemed unnecessary and detracted from understanding the information
,,iqr,baseline,static,simple,The coloring was the biggest thing; having the 3 groupings helped me discern the quartiles directly. Splitting up the transitions made it harder to follow.
,Metaphor Unclear,max,baseline,static,simple,"I like how the data points not relating to maximum dissipate on the 1st graph, compared to the 2nd graph which is an immediate transition my eyes took a little longer to adjust to. I felt the line shown in the 3rd graph misleading, as lines in plotted graphs such as these usually indicate some sort of error in the data."
,Embellished Animation unnecessary,max,baseline,static,simple,"Reference lines don't really help in this case, but it does help to fade out the points so that I know how the maximum was in relation to the other points gradually."
,Animation unnecessary,max,baseline,static,simple,They don’t make much difference because max is easy to see
,Animation Should Be Faster,max,baseline,static,simple,"you could see the other dots disappear and leaving the only one on the top made it intuitive to describe maximum. The graph ranked second was a little too fast and the graph ranked 3rd, I felt like the line going through it was not necessary"
,,min,baseline,static,simple,"Having the fade helps compare the ultimate minimum to other surrounding points, but reference lines just make it harder to see."
,Metaphor Unclear,min,baseline,static,simple,I like how the 1st graph highlights the minimum by leaving it in place while the other data points disappear. I again felt the lines shown on the 3rd graph to be misleading and should be reserved for error bars.
,,min,baseline,static,simple,"Same as max, actually the fade out is sort of helpful"
,,min,baseline,static,simple,This is similar to the last question in that I got to see what exactly was disappearing in a good time period and you didn't see any of the axis changing.
,,stdev,baseline,static,simple,Having the standard deviation overlay a second with the original dots makes the standard deviation more clear as it shows how much dots it covers. The other transitions are not very helpful
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,stdev,baseline,static,simple,I think it's very hard to visualize the calculation of std so all the transitions attempt to do so makes the graph more confusing.
,Animation Should Be Slower,stdev,baseline,static,simple,I think that the delay between the top and bottom half coming in on the two rightmost animations is too slow.
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,stdev,baseline,static,simple,The last two transitions are too confusing and don’t show very much helpful info
,Metaphor Unclear,stdev,baseline,static,simple,"The way the 3rd and 4th charts show one side of the standard deviation before mirroring it across the y-axis doesn't feel like a correct choice for showing the standard deviation. Having the animation in the 1st ranked chart makes it easier to see that the marks are actually at the average, and having both sides of the standard deviation showing in the 2nd ranked chart is better than the 3rd and 4th ranked ones showing one side at a time."
,Embellished animation unnecessary,sum,baseline,static,simple,"Again, the fancy transitions for my 3rd and 4th pick made it feel like I wasn't looking at a transition for Sum."
,,sum,baseline,static,simple,"Same as before, the last two simply detract from the information that is put forward"
Understandable,,avg,elaborate,baseline,simple,1st rank: visually shows what an average is. I think this is the best if someone's unclear exactly what an average is. If you're already familiar with the idea then the 2nd rank is best: short and simple. 3rd rank is quite similar to the second except with extra animation that gets annoying. 4th rank jumps directly to the end and is quite disorienting.
,,avg,elaborate,baseline,simple,"Again, no animation is bad.
The 1st place animation is great for seeing how sums come together to make an average.
The 2nd and 3rd place animation is unclear as to whether it means median or mean"
,,avg,elaborate,baseline,simple,Knowing that every value is accounted for in the average.
Clear Metaphor,Animation Should Be Slower,avg,elaborate,baseline,simple,The bars on the transition marked first give the sense that there is an equal amount on either side of the line making it clearly best.  The line on the transition marked third makes it very unclear whether the measure being taken is average or median since the line disappears very quickly.
Understandable,,median,elaborate,baseline,simple,"I like the 4th one from the left the most because it shows how the median is calculated, which mean the user can better ""trust"" the result. I don't get how the 3rd one from the left is relevant to median.  "
,,sum,elaborate,baseline,simple,"1st could be improved by showing a stacking, but it gives an idea of summing the values of each element, where 3rd seems to simply squish them. 2nd they move up, and it's not the most intuitive, but the trend gives a hint as to sum. 4th had no intuition involved."
Clear Metaphor,,sum,elaborate,baseline,simple,"Clarity of combining all the elements together based on their value, and seeing the line for each point was helpful"
,,sum,elaborate,baseline,simple,"How well the transition showed the data points merging together into the final value. The only real difficulty was between 2 and 3 - overall, 3 felt a little more odd than 2 for depicting sum."
,,sum,elaborate,baseline,simple,Seeing the relative value each data point contributed before summing was nice.
Easy to Follow,,sum,elaborate,baseline,simple,"The 1st place on is easy to follow with the lines.
The second place one naturally combines the values with a smooth animation.
The third one adds a weird line; I don't see how it benefits compared to the second one (which is the animation without the line).
The 4th place one is too difficult to keep track of because it's instant."
Easy to Follow,,sum,elaborate,baseline,simple,The animation helped me track the data points through the transition
Understandable,,sum,elaborate,baseline,simple,"The lines in the transition ranked first give the viewer a sense of adding each value together to get the sum, making it the best transition.  None of the others convey that sense and the animations don't convey much other than changing graphs."
Clear Metaphor,,sum,elaborate,baseline,simple,"The one ranked 1st is my favorite because we can see the lines stacking on top of each other which clearly suggests addition, 2nd one shows combining which also implies addition. I'm not sure what is happening in the 3rd one, but the transition shows a relation between the first and second chart while the 4th one dosn't have any transition which makes it hard to tell there is a relationship between the two graphs/"
,,sum,elaborate,baseline,simple,The use of animations to convey the concept of individual elements being added together

,,stdev,elaborate,baseline,static,Finding the distance among all dots relative to each other and then finding the middle point
Understandable,,stdev,elaborate,baseline,static,"The first place one made the most sense to me, the third didn't."
Clear Metaphor,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,1st makes the most sense since it shows a visual representation of the mathematical operation. 2nd make the next most sense since it shows the average as a point of attention before collapsing. 3rd is next because we understand with the transition that there is *some* operation on the numbers occurring. 4th is last because it is just a hard transition and we aren't sure exactly what is going on.
,More complicated = better,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,1st one I choose shows the quantity of each data point visually and compare the average between others before collapse. And others are just less complicated versions. I like more feather packed animations.
Clear Metaphor,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"1st) Horizontal mark gives an idea of average separate from any element. The delta between that and each element gives an idea of equilibrium on either side.
2nd)  transition is smooth, the horizontal mark gives an idea of average separate from any value. Elements are not being combined, but converge to an average.
3rd) good, but values seem to be combined in some operation
4th) no connection between first and second frames without inference."
,Animation Should Be Slower,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"4th is still abrupt and the resulting meaning of the transition is unclear. 3rd is better than 4th but the resulting meaning could be confusing. To me this animation seems more like a sum animation than an average animation. 2nd is better but I think it could also be confused with median. 1st is the best because it shows the values on either side of the average, although I would like it if the bars stayed for slightly longer."
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,Being able to see all the differences among the points lower and higher than the average was helpful. Getting to see the numbers gather towards the center was second best.
Clear Metaphor,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"for average, it really helps to see the 'area under the curve', to emphasize that selected line really is an average, supported by equal shaded area (by lines)"
,Animation Should Be Slower,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,Having a reference point to compare the average to the data points first is important. If the last transition was a bit slower I think it would be even better.
Understandable,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"Having a trace of how the calculations map to the average is useful, as well as a reference line that is the goal of the calculation. Collapsing is a good way to show an aggregate calculation."
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"I chose #1 and #2 first because I like the line that appears. This shows that the new points are not the same as any of the original points, which differentiates it from an average. I like #1 more than #2 because I think the lines show even more that it is between all the original points. I like #3 more than #4 because the animation did somewhat show that the new points were in the middle of the old points, hinting at an average."
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,I feel like the third one and the fourth one give me the same feeling smooth animation
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,I like extra lines when it comes to understading averge
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,I like the 1st that it greatly shows the reason of the average forming up. The 4th is the worst since nobody knows why it is average by just transferring into two dots. 2nd has the indicator for the average value.
,More complicated = better,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"I like the last one with the fancy animation, but I do think the second from the left is enough for the most cases"
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,I liked how it showed the difference from the values to average showing clearly the average that the values were to converge to.
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,I liked the first graph because you could see the relationship between the average and the rest of the data points in an informative but quick manner. I liked the second graph because the line was drawn which indicates that the average doesn't have to be a particular data point. I thought the 3rd and fourth graph were more ambiguous
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,I liked the graphs that visualize the average immediately and let you kind of confirm this in your head when you look at the lengths up and lengths down
,Metaphor Unclear,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,I think the animation of seeing all the bars representing points that are below the average or above the average helped me decide that. The rest to me seemed very confusing and I ranked based on how smooth the animations are.
Clear Metaphor,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"In the last one, the grid lines of each data point makes it clear that upper ones hold the same area as the lower ones."
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"It's better to see the dots converging, but also important to see why the dots are converging"
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"It's nice to have an explanation of how the average was found so 4 and 3 which have none to little explanations aren't as appealing. Since I know that the first animation in 1 is summation, it is easier to tell how the visualization arrived at the average."
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,More visual aid the better to make it easy to understand
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"My 1st choice shows the 'area' that the elements on either side of the mean contribute to the mean, giving a good sense of it. Between 2nd/3rd, the line through the mean helps orient where the points are moving. 4th's transition was hard to clearly tell what it was doing (mean vs median, etc)."
Appealing,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"Same as the others, how appealing and how it shows the work done."
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,Showing how all the values factor into the average as in the last graph helps the user see what the average mean across the data points.
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,Showing how the middle point is being derived based on the relative position to the bottom axis
Clear Metaphor,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The 1st and 2rd ones make it really hard to understand whether its mean or median. The 3rd one is more effective since the line is not at a point, so the audience knows its probably conveys the average. The 4th is the most effective since it agrees with my idea of exactly what average is, so there is no elimination involved."
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"the added bars show that it's considering the values, which shows average better"
Clear Metaphor,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The fourth chart shows the distance of each point to the average, which is clear. The second and third chart actually are in a tie, in that they both provides the transition of each data point to the average. The first chart is worse since it does not have any transition."
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,The fourth one can better persuade me that is the average
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The last transition is the best for me because it shows not only where the average is with respect to the elements in the set, but also a quick bar chart showcasing where those points are with respect to that average. This describes the average the best. The third transition only shows where the average is with a line, which is what the last transition does, so it is second. The third transition only merges the points to that average, so it is only third. The first transition is static and provides no aid to describe the average, so it is last."
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The one ranked 4th had no transition, so it was hard to tell the relation between the 1st and second chart. I ranked the one with the dots merging 3rd because it is hard to tell why the dots are merging and where they are merging to. The one with the dots merging to the line is 2nd because it gives the point where they are merging, if not why they are merging. The one with the bars are 1st because it the bars suggest why they are merging and the line tells us where they are merging to."
Clear Metaphor,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The one with the mini plots was effective since it showed what was going on.  The one with the horizontal lines was good because it showed where the average would be, and it is not always where a dot is.  The one without the horizontals was still better than static one"

,,count,elaborate,simple,baseline,How appealing the visualization looks and how it shows the work done.
,,count,elaborate,simple,baseline,I decided the first and the second because it forms a column of points. This way it is easier for me to see that you are counting.
,,count,elaborate,simple,baseline,"ok, since I prefer smooth transition and good visual motion"
Clear Metaphor,,count,elaborate,simple,baseline,Showing how each value gets counted is intuitive before collapsing
Clear Metaphor,,count,elaborate,simple,baseline,Stacking the dots gives a sense of counting them while directly transitioning is not very helpful
Clear Metaphor,,count,elaborate,simple,baseline,The animation makes the transition much more clearer so 3rd and 4th chart are much better than the other two.
,,count,elaborate,simple,baseline,The sense of one by one counting makes it the clearest it is count.
Clear Metaphor,,count,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The way animation was used to build up the data points together, as if they were being counted in front of the viewer"
Clear Metaphor,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,1st is very clear with discrete animations and a different color for each quartile. 2nd is good with coloring but the simultaneous animations are quite hard to track. 3rd may be confused with average and standard deviation. 4th is simply too abrupt to catch and also may be confused with average and standard deviation.
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,"4th and 3rd are similar to the previous graphs. 2nd and 1st are more useful than 3rd and 4th because of the color coding, but both 1st and 2nd could have been slower so that the animation was more clear. 1st is better than 2nd because of the staggering, which points to the fact that points are being counted and sorted into their range."
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,"Based on previous preference of median, the last one is clear that it is dealing with median."
More complicated = better,Measure Was Too Confusing,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,"I am not sure what interquartile range with median is, but the 1st one I choose looks more complicated animation so I like it more."
,Measure Was Too Confusing,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,I don't know what's Interquartile Range with Median but I think the last transition effectively shows the process of finding them.
Clear Metaphor,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,I like the 4th one from the left the best because it show how the median is calculated.
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,"I liked #1 and #2 because the use of color made it clear that it was calculating a quartile since there were four different colors. I chose #1 over #2 because the animation further emphasized that it was splitting into quarters. I chose #3 over #4 because the animation was better than nothing, but I don't think #3 was more obviously interquartile range than #4."
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,I really like the transition where two points are accounted for at each step. This makes it easy to see that the ending scene is of a median and the interquartile range.
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,I should say this is very similar to the previous one. I should copy and paste.
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,"I'm not sure what interquartile range is, but I think the last two animations did a good job of expressing something related to four groups and the average"
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,median is showed better in highest ranked transition as compared to 2nd ranked
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,"Same as before, how appealing and how it shows the work done."
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,Showing how all the values factor into the median as in the last graph helps the user see what the average mean across the data points.
Clear Metaphor,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,"Showing the process of dividing up the points by quartiles and color-coding it was really helpful for showing the interquartile ranges. The more they showed the process of dividing the points, the higher I ranked it"
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,smooth animation and transition rule everything and I can not find other reason.
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The color really helped, so did the lines. I like extra lines"
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The last two charts are in a tie. The third one demonstrate how the range is formed, and the fourth one demonstrates how the  median was found. The second chart's transition actually has nothing to do with standard deviation or median. It is basically the same as the first one."
Understandable,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,The median was most obviously computed in the fourth graphic (because of the counting-inwards animation).
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,The more visual aid the better and easier to understand
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,"This time I find the extra animation helpful because the computation is more complex, and the transitions and movement help show how each point contributes to the calculation."
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,Whether it shows the middle line is median and it's a quartile on each side
,Annoying,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,"1st and second place are interchangable. They both capture the idea of points ""canceling each other out"", although the more involved animation could become annoying on more data."
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,1st is great since it counts each discrete data point one by one until the center value. 2nd is good as it also divides the two halves into separate colors. 3rd may be confused to average. 4th is simply too abrupt to catch.
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,"4th is abrupt and unclear like on the previous graphs. 3rd is better than 4th because in this case you see the median appear while the other dots fade, but this isn't going to be the case if Set 1 has an odd number of numbers. 2nd puts a clear split between the points which is helpful, but 1st does this even better since it seems to count for the audience, letting them know that they are going one by one from each end of the set. If there are too many data points to clearly see that there are equal counts above and below the median, then 2nd is much less effective than 1st."
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,Having the line drop down is very clear that we are finding the median
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,how smooth the transition and animation could be and how good those feature could be presented
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,How the transitions display that a central item was chosen.
Understandable,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,I like 1st one the most because it actually count the median in animation so that people watching this has a better sense that it's a median. Even people do not now what is median will understand what the chart is trying to show.
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,I like how it counted from up and down to get the median
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,I like that it looks like both sides are being counted in front of the viewer
Understandable,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,"I liked #1 and #2 the best because the use of color and line clearly demonstrates that it is finding a midpoint and half are above the line and half are below. I chose #1 over #2 because the moving line implied that it is moving towards the middle by counting from the edge, which made it more clearly median as opposed to average. I chose #3 over #4 because I liked the animation more than nothing."
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,I loved the last one because I was sure it was the median because each step eliminated the outer two data points. However it was a bit fast in the end.
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,"In the last one, the one by one counting towards the middle part"
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,"In the transition marked first, the counting down on each point gives the clear sense that median is the measure being taken on the data."
Understandable,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,Showing how all the values factor into the median as in the last graph helps the user see what the median means across the data points. Usage of color and counting of points on each side of bar also really helps.
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,"Since median is often computed by counting in from the side, the fourth graphic presents it most naturally."
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,Splitting all the dots in two groups and then focusing on the middle point
Clear Metaphor,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,The 4th one was very clear that it was counting from both sides even if the animation was long. Stylistically I liked the 3rd one but it wasn't as clear. The 3rd and 4th were less and less clear what the value they were converging to was.
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The ability to count helps in the 4th one. The 3rd one facilitates that by just color coding, but that's also effective and helpful."
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,the animation of the 4th chart makes the transition of median clearer because it shows the steps of finding a median
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,The colors really helped separate the high from low values
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,the extra movement is very helpful in terms of the idea of median
Clear Metaphor,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The first place one is great here - does median the way i think about median, taking off values from each end of the sorted values. The others are all hard to tell apart from average"
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The fourth chart is the best int hat it helps the user count the median. The third chart does something similar, but not step by step. The second chart's transition is somewhat useless, but still better than having no transition."
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The last one is the best since it shows how the work is done, the others are too slow and doesn't feel like much is happening."
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,The more visual aid the better and easier to understanding
Clear Metaphor,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,The one where they bounce towards each other is smy favorite because it shows the idea that the median means being in the middle which means having the same number of points on each side.  The other one with different colored dots was good too.
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,"the slightly slower animation shows what's happening since it goes through each point, which makes it describe median better"
,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,This is similar to the reason of average. The 1st is so good that we can count to the median.
Clear Metaphor,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,Whether it clearly marks there are same number elements on both sides
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,1) Whether it clearly marks the average 2) and it's 1 std above not within
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,1st is good. It shows average and the SD right next to it. 2nd provides a good visual sequence from top to bottom. It expands the graph.
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"1st) gives an idea of relation between the deviation from mean and the standard deviation mark.
2nd) gives an idea of equal sides to the deviation around an average, but not correlation between that and the elements individual deviation. 
3rd) fine, but unclear that its not inner-quartile range
4th) no correlation without inference."
,Measure Was Too Confusing,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,4th is better than the previous graphs since it at least gives the indication that it's showing standard deviation even though it's not clear if average or median is being used as the center. 3rd is very similar to 4th but the fade out of the points gives the audience some information about from what the standard deviation was calculated. 2nd and 1st are ranked that way because it seems like they do more to showcase how the standard deviation was calculate but i'm not really sure how it's calculated in the first place so...
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"Based on my previous preference of average, the last one is clear that we are doing things related to average."
,Measure Was Too Confusing,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"Following my rationale for the average, my 1st choices's bars helped make the intuition correct; similar rationale for 4/3/2 as my average one. However, I don't think any of the animations do a good job of showing how the standard deviation was created."
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"Having the lines beneath each dot helps a lot, otherwise isn't clear what operation is being done"
Clear Metaphor,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,I chose #1 and #2 because they were more clearly calculating an average and then showing the same size range on either side of the average line. I think the fact that one half showed up before the other was significant because it made it clear that the area above and below the middle line are different. I chose #3 over #4 because I liked the animation better than nothing.
,Measure Was Too Confusing,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"I didn’t particularly think any were intuitive, because I don’t often see standard deviation represented in charts"
,Measure Was Too Confusing,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"I honestly don't understand std dev enough to comment on its graph, and none of the graphs really helped"
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,i like extra animation and extra lines in order to understand data
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,I liked seeing how far each point deviated from the mean before the one standard deviation boxes were drawn.
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,I ranked them by how much they showed the process of calculating the standard deviation and average. It was also nice that it showed that the length was the same on either side.
,Measure Was Too Confusing,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"I ranked these in order of information they provide about what it is describing. I'm not really sure how standard deviation is normally calculated, so the details they have really help in my understanding of standard deviation."
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"I think the 4th one from the left the most because it shows how the data is distributed first, then  describe the standard deviation"
,Measure Was Too Confusing,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,I'm honestly not really sure since I don't have a very good idea of what standard deviation is
Clear Metaphor,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"In this case, I felt that the ""bar chart"" animation really helped demonstrate how the figure was generated."
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,once again the bars show the values of the points are being considered for the average
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"once again, i like the area representation when showing where average is. 

fading and instant change on plot are very hard to see."
Understandable,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,Showing how all the values factor into the average as in the last graph helps the user see what the average mean across the data points. The tilt of the points also allows the user to see why the size of the standard deviation bars are as is.
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,smooth animation and explicit visual moving from first state to last one
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,The 1st one first shows the process of finding the mean and than the standard deviation which is nice. The second one is a little more clear than 3rd and 4th but not much better.
Clear Metaphor,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,The animation for calculating the average made that part clear. The double bars showed that it was likely standard deviation or IQR.
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The bars are good to show an average is being calculated, and the transition is helpful to show how the data is being changed."
Clear Metaphor,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The fourth graphic's discretization makes average very clear, and the standard deviation logically follows."
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The last transition had a bar chart appear when the points were shown, and they all converged to create the standard deviation plot, so that helped the most with describing one standard deviation with the average. The third transition did not have this bar chart, but had the points converge to that plot, so it is second. The second transition just showed the plot after a brief moment, which did nothing to aid in describing One standard deviation with average, so it came in third. The first transition had no animations, which is worse than the third one for describe one standard deviation, so it came last."
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,The last two charts are in a tie. They demonstrate how the deviation is formed. The second chart's transition actually has nothing to do with standard deviation. It is basically the same as the first one.
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,The more visual aid the easier and better to understand
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,What made the most sense for the standard deviation. Being able to see the standard deviation calculation is nice.
,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,"Easy to see why the dots are moving the way they do....the movement tells you an operation is being done on them, and the specific way they move is how: the bars are needed to show they are being stacked on top."
,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,"For sum, it's useful to have them collapsing into each other to show aggregation. But reference lines help enormously in either case, as well as multiple smaller transitions that help me stay oriented."
Clear Metaphor,Static is magic,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,"I chose #1 because I think showing the area under the points makes it much clearer that it is summing the points. #2 was a nice animation but nothing about it made me know immediately that it was a sum like with #1. I still thought it was better than #3 because the lines made me at least somewhat think of the space under the point, which makes me think of the sum. #4 did not have any animation so I just had to guess what was being calculated."
Appealing,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,I like how appealing and how it shows the work done.
,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,I like the extra lines that aid me with understanding the data
,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,I liked being able to follow the dots and seeing that things were being added together
,Static is magic,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,I think the 1st choice is the only one that shows that it's doing anything regarding sum at all - the others just kind of pull a number out of nowhere that the dots go to
Clear Metaphor,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,"it's important that you see the bars ""stacking"" on each other to show the concept of a sum"
,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,Seeing everything collapsing is nice. Lack of animation is hard. Only the 1st one shows how the totals collapse clearly to me
Clear Metaphor,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,Showing the gird lines of each data points in the last one makes it clear that we are adding each together.
,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,Showing the heights of the values as a line brought to attention the fact that we were summing up the values. Showing the differentiation in heights showed how the points were contributing
Clear Metaphor,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,Showing the size of each component with a line and then combining them shows visual representation of sum well.
Clear Metaphor,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,"Showing the value of each data point as a length and then showing them ""add"" together with the transition  makes the most sense for adding. The 3rd place shows that the y-axis is growing better than the 4th place."
Understandable,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The 1st choice 'shows' how the data is being summed up, with the 2nd almost accomplishing this as well. The 3rd has some strange behavior when the sum is physically placed lower than the position of the max point (those points collapse downwards into the sum), but the transition still helps associate elements."
Interesting,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,The animation for 1st is more interesting it has showed the value of individual data points before collapse them into the aggregated form. Others are less interesting.
Clear Metaphor,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,The animation. The first animation you can see all of the points accumulate to make a sum while the rest don't
Clear Metaphor,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The discretization of the values, followed by the overlaying of the sum value that is visibly the sum of the discrete values."
Understandable,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The fourth chart display how the values are accumulated, which is a very good transition. The second and third chart looked good, but the transition is not very helpful. But since the transition are not misleading, they are better than the first chart, which has no animation"
Clear Metaphor,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,The lines in the first one made it more obvious that were adding all the sums together - although it is still somewhat unclear
,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,The points in the 1st and 2nd rank animation look like they are adding instead of averaging together.
Understandable,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,"The reason why I placed the last transition as first was because it first transitioned the points into a little bar chart, and then showed another animation merging these points together. This was really cool to see and describes what Sum does well the most. The third transition simply collapsed all of the points and showed a 1-dimensional line graph merge animation, which is what the last transition did but better, which is why it came in second. The second transition simply merged all of the points together and transitioned the axis, which is what the aforementioned two transitions already did but better with the additional line chart animation, so it comes in third. The first transition lacked any transitions at all, which is why it comes last."
Clear Metaphor,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,The values look more like they are being counted and summed in front of the viewer
Clear Metaphor,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,The way each data point had a line made it easy to see they all had contribution to the ending point. This made it clear that it was a sum.
,,avg,elaborate,simple,static,showing how the top and bottom bars are roughly equal is nice. static transition and moving the dots is easy to miss
,Metaphor Unclear,avg,elaborate,simple,static,The merging dots in the 2nd viz was confusing. The good viz's had additional markings to clarify that this was an average.
Understandable,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,count,elaborate,simple,static,"1st has discrete, easy to track animations while showing all data points. 2nd shows all data points, which is good, but is a bit confusing because it's rather hard to track all the different data points simultaneously. 3rd is simply switching charts. 4th is confusing because merging all data points into one seem as if it's doing a sum operation."
Clear Metaphor,,count,elaborate,simple,static,"The first one appears to be counting the individual dots, the second one takes all the dots and spaces them evenly. Both are easy to understand but the 1st one, the visualization is more like what i do mentally. I didn't like the 4th because it seems to be merging the dots, not how I visualize counting.e"
Clear Metaphor,,iqr,elaborate,simple,static,"I think the way the colors lay out helps me to understand where does each quartile belong too. Again, I have ranked based on how clean the animations are."
Clear Metaphor,,iqr,elaborate,simple,static,"Like before, showing the full process of finding the interquartile range, like showing the median finding process in 1 is helpful in identifying the calculation being visualized. I liked 2 just as much, the color separation is really helpful. I find the fading in 4 really unhelpful in this case as it just clutters up the graph for a bit."
Clear Metaphor,,median,elaborate,simple,static,I like the counting motion in 1 which is how I usually visualize finding a median. Separating out the top half and bottom half in colors in 2 is much better than the median just appearing. The fading dots in 4 are actually more confusing than the median just showing up in 3.
Clear Metaphor,,median,elaborate,simple,static,The animation of picking the median helped clarify that the new data points shown were for the median.
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,stdev,elaborate,simple,static,"4th is just unclear, 3rd - lack of animation is tough to track, 1st and 2nd are about the same"
,Metaphor Unclear,stdev,elaborate,simple,static,"The 3rd and 4th switched here since the 2nd vis seemed like it was making the values up, it didn't look realistic"
Clear Metaphor,,stdev,elaborate,simple,static,The same reason as the previous question. It just came more intuitive to me.
,Annoying,stdev,elaborate,simple,static,The slow fade-outs are just annoying sometimes. Visualizing the bars was by far the most helpful.
Clear Metaphor,Animation Unnecessary,sum,elaborate,simple,static,"1st option: is quite similar to the 2nd one, but it evokes the idea of stacking slightly better. my 4th pick is just sort of confusing what exactly it's doing - seems to be animation for no real good."
,,sum,elaborate,simple,static,How we are treating each dot with its height in the sum
Clear Metaphor,,sum,elaborate,simple,static,"I like to 1st so much. It displays why the numbers are summed up. 2nd is also good since I can see the scale changing, which is helpful to recognize that it is a sum."
Understandable,,sum,elaborate,simple,static,Show the process of the sum is more easy to understand
,Animation Unnecessary,sum,elaborate,static,baseline,"I think besides my the first and the last graph, the transitions in the other two graphs are very misleading and confusing."

,Metaphor Unclear,sum,elaborate,static,baseline,"They were all terrible in showing sum. The least terrible was the plot with most detail. Unless we actually count up each value how would we know they are calculating sum. Just guessing. Add some plus signs, add up small values at first then add those values,...something to show you are summing. Or even annotate ""These values are being summed"""
,"Animation Should Be Slower, Animation Should Be Faster",max,static,elaborate,baseline,Plot 3 would have been the best but it was too slow. Plot 1 is fast enough. But may lack detail. The middle plot was too slow and so is useless.
,Animation Should Be Faster,min,static,elaborate,baseline,"Pretty much the same as minimum transitions. The 3rd plot is way too slow and will be annoying to the viewer. The 2nd has more detail but is too slow, the first is okay."
,"Couldn't Follow Complex Animations, Metaphor Unclear",avg,simple,static,baseline,"The 4th is interesting but too distracting. The one I ranked 1st, looks like values converge into the line. It could be convincing that it is calculating average. None of these are obvious that it transitions to the average.

,Animation Should Be Faster,median,static,simple,elaborate,"Well the 3rd ranked was the most fun to watch but it didn't quite have animations that were helpful towards the transition. The same with the 2nd, moving the dots to the side aren't helpful. The 1st was fastest and most useful towards the goal. 4th is too slow."

,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"Same reason for average, the lines drawing from each data point to the average line tells a lot"
,Embellished Animation Unnecessary,iqr,simple,elaborate,baseline,Divide into 4 groups and take the central 2 groups is basically the definition of Interquartile Range with Median. The last one has too much animation I think

,Static is Magic,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,I like the smooth transition more than the chunky one. The 3rd in the ranking is too slow and the lack of transition is too confusing.
,Metaphor Unclear,sum,baseline,elaborate,simple,It doesn't have any of the confusing lines the 2nd and 3rd ranked ones have. The second ranked one makes more sense than the 3rd. The no transitions was the most confusing.

,"Embellished Animation Unnecessary, Static is Magic",avg,simple,elaborate,baseline,"the bars are too extra, the shrinking is strange without the average line, and no transition doesn't suggest that the two points are averages."
,Couldn't Follow Complex Animations,median,simple,elaborate,baseline,the dropping is distracting and doesn't make it clear that it is the median. The fading out and no transition doesn't make it clear that it is the median.
,Metaphor Unclear,stdev,simple,elaborate,baseline,"the bar chart confuses me, the fading-in and no transition feels like the box is unrelated to the points"
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,"More time to figure out the colors, boxes feel more related to the points."
,,count,simple,elaborate,static,"The first place option was good since it smoothly put all the points at increments of 1 unit, so it was easy to tell. The 2nd place one did this but the transition was not as smooth and harder to follow (or at least uglier so I perceived it that way). The 3rd and 4th don't communicate anything towards ""count"", the 3rd place one doesn't have an animation so it is faster and more effective from time analysis only."
,,sum,simple,elaborate,static,"the 1st one has a line that communicates the points are tied together, so the sum makes more sense. The 2nd one lines them up together, but it makes me think of seperate points in a trend which is not useful, but since it morphs into the first place design, it is good. 3rd place was quicker than the 4th one due to no animation so it was better since 4th doesn't really tell me anything, it just shoves all the points together."
,Animation Unnecessary,max,elaborate,baseline,static,"Little difference among the visualizations. The 1st place one draws attention to the max values so it clues you in on why others are disappearing. Other than that, I feel max is something intuitive enough to understand"
,Animation Unnecessary,min,elaborate,baseline,static,No difference from the previous Max questions. The 1st place transition shows some empasis on the min to understand why others are disappearing but min should be a fairly easy concept to grasp regardless of the transition.
,,avg,elaborate,simple,static,"little difference between first and second, they just let you see the average clearly and distance from the average in the first one. fourth one just combines points which is useless so the third place gets 3rd for being faster than the 4th place one."
,Static is Magic,median,elaborate,simple,static,"First and second both show which points are on which side of calculating the median which is the main clue in. First place lets you see the step by step so it gets first. Fourth place is just confusing, removing the dots doesn't hint me at median, it doesn't hint me towards anything especially since a new dot appears, it could be a new data set."
,Metaphor Unclear,stdev,elaborate,simple,static,"Same answer as calculating the average. Averages are shown the same way and I feel none of them really convey the standard deviation other than it ""appearing"""
Clear Metaphor,,iqr,elaborate,simple,static,"Seeing the separation of points into quartiles step by step in the 1st place transition helps communicate the quartiles and the medians. Doing it step by step lets the user understand how the points are being separated. which puts it above the second one that does not do this. The 4th place one reveals no information, it is just a fade in so since it takes more time than 3rd place, it comes in last."
Clear Metaphor,,count,baseline,simple,elaborate,"The one I ranked first conveyed count the best to me because it showed the elements being combined, and it was a smooth transition. The 2nd best was good because it arranged the points unit distance from each other which very clearly conveyed what it was doing. That may have been better than the first, but I liked the transition on the first better. Third and fourth place just weren't as good because the third transition was not smooth and the fourth had no transition at all and I had to figure out what to make of it with no context."
Clear Metaphor,,sum,elaborate,baseline,simple,"The lines in the transition I ranked first were important in my mind because it showed that it wasn't just a count, it was summing the individual distances from 0. Third place was just like the 2nd place transition but with lines that didn't really convey any meaning to me. Fourth place again just had no context."
,Animation Unnecessary,max,static,elaborate,baseline,"In this case, it was easiest to understand with no transition because the scale wasn't changing and the first place one makes it obvious that we're just ignoring all but the max points. 2nd place was nice because it drew attention to the max points with the horizontal lines, and 3rd place was just too slow."
,,min,static,elaborate,baseline,"Same justification for max, although for some reason the horizontal lines in the second place transition seemed more appealing this time. Not sure why but it didn't make sense to me to rank max and min transitions differently."
Clear Metaphor,Embellished Animation Unnecessary,avg,simple,baseline,elaborate,The first and second are similar in my mind but the horizontal line makes it more clear what it's being combined toward whereas the transition without the line is a little more ambiguous about what it's going toward until the transition ends. The third place was cool but seemed unnecessarily detailed. Fourth place was just unclear because there was no transition.
,Animation Should Be Slower,median,simple,elaborate,baseline,I ranked the third transition 1st place because I thought it did the best job of showing the separation of the top and bottom halves as well as the point added when there was no median point. 2nd place was just a little harder to follow because the transition tried to show each point individually but did it too quickly toward the end and it wasn't really necessary to go point-by-point because there's already a natural separation isn't going to have any interesting outlier points. The 3rd and 4th place transitions just didn't really give a good indication of what it was doing.
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"I feel like this is a difficult concept to show, but the 1st place one did a good job because it showed finding the average as well as the individual distances which help understand where the standard deviations come from."
Understandalbe,,iqr,simple,elaborate,baseline,"Given that I didn't understand interquartile range before this, I think the 3rd transition showed it best because it showed the distinctions between the quarters and showed where the median was. The color and position groupings were helpful to my understanding but as with a previous one, the 2nd place transition unnecessarily made each point distinct rather than grouping in the intuitive way. The 3rd and 4th place transitions just didn't really give a good indication of what was going on."
,,count,elaborate,simple,baseline,The more effective transitions have additional steps and detail. They decompose the process into fine-grained sub-steps
Clear Metaphor,,sum,elaborate,baseline,simple,"The best transition uses additional details which accord with how one might imagine arranging elements if they were physical objects in the world. For the second-best transition, I chose the one I was more familiar with from the previous exercise over the one which overlays a single vertical line. I feel the single line does not map to a real-world object metaphor in the same way which the multiple-lines-as-sticks-stacked-end-to-end does, but I may just prefer the transition I was exposed to during the previous exercise due to some sort of priming bias."
,,max,elaborate,baseline,static,The best transition draws additional attention to the significant data points
,,min,elaborate,baseline,static,Same as previous- the best transition draws attention to the elements of interest
,,avg,elaborate,simple,baseline,The additional details in the superior transitions help me as an interpreter to anticipate the location of the calculated mean
Clear Metaphor,Embellished Animation Unnecessary,median,simple,elaborate,baseline,"The use of color to delineate elements on either side of the median is really helpful, but in this case the additional animations don't provide additional clarity. Perhaps here, color is *so* useful, that the additional steps seem a superfluous distraction."
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,The animations which convey the process of averaging are also useful here.
Clear Metaphor,Embellished Animation Unnecessary,iqr,simple,elaborate,baseline,I extend my reasoning from the median transition and apply it here. Color is supremely useful. Additional animations are distracting.
,,count,elaborate,simple,baseline,Being able to see what operation was happening. Especially seeing the dots being equally spaced and then aggregated helped.
,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,"Again, the transition of being able to see the rank being aggregated helped much, along with the changing scale."
,,max,elaborate,baseline,static,"The horizontal line emphasized the maximum effect, which helped me decide the rank."
,,min,elaborate,baseline,static,"Same reason as before, seeing the horizontal line helped me decipher that this was a range."
,,avg,elaborate,baseline,simple,seeing the bar graph enumerated as a distribution of the points really helped to contextualize what was happening in the graph.
Clear Metaphor,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,The first one was executing the actual process of finding the median by getting rid of numbers and so it was the best.
,,stdev,elaborate,simple,baseline,"Same reasons as before, seeing the bar graph distribution really helped to contextualize what was happening"
,,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,The separation of the points by each quartile helped to show that things were being separated into its interquartile range.
,,count,elaborate,simple,baseline,I liked how it lined up on the tick marks
,,sum,elaborate,simple,baseline,I liked seeing the y-axis scale and the vertical lines that lined the dots
,,max,baseline,static,elaborate,I like seeing some animation so I know the graph changed. The lines in the 3rd option seemed too cluttered
,,min,baseline,static,elaborate,Same reasoning as the maximum transitions. I liked the animation to see how the graph is updating
,Metaphor Unclear,avg,baseline,simple,static,I liked the animations. I don't think the line is necessary and I don't think making the circles line up horizontally first added to my understanding
Clear Metaphor,,median,simple,elaborate,baseline,"I liked how the dots change color, since that helps in visualizing counting on both ends to find the median"
,"Metaphor Unclear, Animations Unnecessary",stdev,static,baseline,simple,I don't think making the bars line up horizontally before getting pushed together helped with my understanding. I liked the graph without animations the best in this case just because I don't think the animations helped with my understanding much
,Embellished Animation Unnecessary,iqr,simple,static,baseline,I dont think the fading animation helped with my understanding. I did like the colors
Understandable,,count,simple,elaborate,baseline,Any animation is better than none for letting us establish what changed. The animation I marked as first really conveys the idea of counting obects by placing points equidistant from each other signifying that we don't care about their actual value. The same goes for the one I ranked 2nd but I disliked the multi step nature of the animation. The one I ranked third doesn't make it clear what operation is taking place. Could be a mean for all we know.
,,sum,simple,elaborate,baseline,1st and 2nd place are best at conveying the concept of a sum. I prefer the cleanliness of the 1st better but the 2nd is also good. It's not clear what operation is occurring in 3rd or 4th place.
,,max,elaborate,baseline,static,These are all pretty good. I ranked 1st because it uses the lines to draw your attention to the max but honestly these are all fine.
,,min,elaborate,baseline,static,They're close. Slight preference for 1st but 2nd is fine too.
,,avg,simple,baseline,elaborate,1st and 2nd are good but I like the line 1st draws. 3rd is really fancy but I don't think the fancy animation adds value.
Clear Metaphor,,median,elaborate,simple,baseline,I like the fancy median transition because it makes it very clear what median is. The 2nd place transition is also fantastic. 3rd place it isn't clear that we're taking a median
,Metaphor Unclear,stdev,simple,elaborate,baseline,I don't think that it's obvious that any of these are one standard deviation from the mean. I don't think the extra animation in 2nd place contributed to understanding.
,Metaphor Unclear,iqr,elaborate,simple,baseline,Again the 1st place animation made the process clear. 2nd place gave us a hint. Rest were unclear.
