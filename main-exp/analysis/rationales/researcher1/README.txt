Notes

- I aggregate the tagged responses across aggregate operations. In turn within group, I divided again into the first placed transition style. E.g., the reponses from participants who favored the elaborate count transition, responses from who favored the simple count transition, ....
- Here, "elaborate", "simple", "baseline", and "static" correspond to "staged elaborate", "staged basic", "interpolated", and "static" terms in the paper.
- The belows are findings from each aggregate operation and their summary.

---------

## Count

=> Elaborate got voted as 1st since it looks like counting points one by one.
=> Simple got voted as 1st since it spreads out the points evenly, move smoothly, and looks like counting.
=> Elaborate got less voted since its animation is jitter and unnecessary.
=> Static / baseline got 1st place since elaborate and simple transitions are unnecessary.


## Sum

=> Elaborate is the best since the animation looks like adding/stacking up the points, and the extra vertical lines are helpful.
=> Simple is the best since the animation looks like adding/stacking up the points, and the extra vertical lines are helpful.
=> Elaborate is confusing and has unnecessary motions/elements.
=> Baseline is the best since it collapses/merges the points which looks like summing, and changes the axis as well.
=> Elaborate and simple transitions are confusing.


## Max

=> Elaborate is the best since it highlights the maximum by the tikcs.
=> Basline is too slow, static is abrupt and doesn't have animation.
=> Baseline is the best since it fades-out the points.
=> Elaborate has unnecessary animations/ticks.
=> Static is abrupt.
=> Static is the best since it is simple
=> Baseline is too slow. The elaborate's ticks are misleading.


## Min (42 are the same as max)
Min was similar to Max.


## AVG

=> Elaborate is the best since it explain why it is the avg by showing how each point contributes to the avg and that the upper area (bars) are the same as the lower area (bars).
=> Simple is the 2nd place which draws the line at the avgs guiding the points are merged there.
=> Simple is the best which draws the line at the avgs guiding the points are merged there.
=> Elaborate has unnecessarily complicated animations.
=> Basline is the best since it moves points to the middle and it is straightforward.
=> Elaborate and simple transitions have extra distracting motions.


## Median
=> Elaborate is the best because it explains the median by counting the upper half points and the lower half points.
=> Simple is the second place since it separates into the upper and the lower well.
=> Simple is the best since it separates into the upper and the lower well.
=> Elaborate has too many transitions and is distracting. It's fast at the end.
=> Baseline and Static are hard to tell what it means.


## STDEV
=> Elaborate is the best since it explains the concept by showing the average with the bars
=> Simple is the best since it explains the concept by showing the average and it is simple
=> Elaborate is distracting and overwhelming.
=> Baseline is the best because it shows the +/- stdev together and keep the points while the transition.
=> Elaborate and Simple are bad since they show the sides one by one.
=> 9 : hard to understand the transitions


## IQR
=> Elaborate is the best because it draws the median clearly and colors the quartiles.
=> Simple is the best because it separates into quartiles by using colors well .
=> Elaborate has unnecessary animations and is a bit too much.





=======
Summary
=======
1. Elaborate and simple are favored becuase theses transitions explain corresponding concepts well.
2. Elaborate looks having unnecessary transition steps for people who prefer simple.
3. In sum operation, people prefer the baseline because collapsing data points looks like combining values so it makes sense as the sum.
4. Baseline is hard to tell what it means. static is too abrupt.
5. A few people didn't understand what STDEV and IQR transitions mean.

minor. In count operation, the elaborate is interpreted as counting the points but the simple is recognized as spreading out the points evenly.
