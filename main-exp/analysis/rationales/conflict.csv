43,median,"I thought the second and first ranked transitions were both good, but the second ranked was a little fast/ had too much going on. The third one was ok, but there is no explanation for why those two dots replaced all the previous dots. The fourth one had no transition so it seemed there was no relationship between the first and second chart.",,Animation Should Be Faster
105,max,"you could see the other dots disappear and leaving the only one on the top made it intuitive to describe maximum. The graph ranked second was a little too fast and the graph ranked 3rd, I felt like the line going through it was not necessary",,Animation Should Be Faster
255,count,"1st and 2nd could be interchangeable since I don't prefer one over the other. 4th is because the jump from values to counts is abrupt and also unclear. 3rd is because is it also somewhat unclear - without the numbers on the side, it could easily have been average or median. 1st and 2nd lay out all the dots in a line so it's more clear that it's the count.",Clear Metaphor,Animation Should Be Faster
106,iqr,"The fade-out is once again slow and adds nothing. The color-coding is useful, although I don't think the slower version where they sort themselves adds much value. It's easy enough to get the idea from the distribution of the colors.",Clear metaphor,Animation Should Be Slower
213,max,"howing the line as a new feature draws your eye to the maximum before getting rid of the data which makes it first place. Second place is obvious immediately what has happened, but you don't get a moment to see the data with the maximum highlighted. Third place is confusing since the fade out is so long, that you don't really understand the significance of the dots that aren't fading until all other dots have faded completely.",Clear metaphor,Animation Should Be Slower
446,min,"As with the previous question, 1st makes the most sense since it draws attention to the minimum before the fade out transition. 2nd makes it apparent immediately what has happened. 3rd is confusing as the fade out is so long that you just think all data points are fading until it is done and you realize two haven't faded.",Clear metaphor,Animation Should Be Slower
